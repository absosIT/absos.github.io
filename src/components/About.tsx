        The main purpose of establishing this organization is to purify human souls, educate humans, prevent humans from doing evil, and do some good things for society, the country, and the world. In addition, it also emphasizes the decent behaviors that human beings need to learn, such as being loyal to the country, respecting the elderly, being filial to parents, etc., and praying for peace in the country and peace in the world. Typically, we have regular rituals in the evening, which have some regular formats such as prayers, chanting, and worship. Afterwards there are lectures by leaders and Bible study classes among members. The purpose of worship is for us to learn the Buddha’s merits, sincerity, purity, equality, cosmic truth, and compassion. Through these, humans can be educated on how to alleviate the worries and pain caused by wrong behaviors such as greed, anger, ignorance, and jealousy, and thus help us achieve the happiest and most perfect life in our lives.
